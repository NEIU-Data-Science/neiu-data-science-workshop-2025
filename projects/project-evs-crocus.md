# Environmental Science Data with CROCUS

## Project Description

This project will focus on using tools to access weather/climate data, as a demonstration of working with environmental science-oriented workflows. During this breakout, we will:
- Learn how to work with timeseries-oriented observations
- Use tools such as pandas and matplotlib to analyze weather/climate observations at the Northeastern Illinois University site
- Learn about resources to visualize geospatial data using open-source python tools

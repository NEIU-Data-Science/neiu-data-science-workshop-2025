# Data Science with KBase
 
## Pre requisites

Create KBase Account: https://docs.kbase.us/getting-started/sign-up/step-by-step
 
## Project Description
 
This project will focus on bringing data science into the biology classroom. We will be using data generated in KBase to provide examples of how microbial data can be used in the classroom. During this breakout, we will:
- Learn about KBase
- Use Python code to do phenotype predictions, clustering analysis, and relative abundance analyses
- Visualize these analyses in python  
 
## Expected Outcomes
 
- Learn how to work with Kbase
- Use tools such as pandas, numpy, seaboarn, and matplotlib to analyze KBase data
- Learn how to create visualizations that can be used the in the classroom 
 
## Skills required
 
Basic experience with Python and a willingness to learn.

    " - A large language model (LLM) is a collection of statistics that allow us to tell what words may come before or after another set of words with constraints. For example, what is the most likely words could be placed in the blanks in: \"May the ____ be with ______\" in a Star Wars context or in a Catholic Mass context.\n",
    "  - A GPT (Generative Pre-Trained Transformer). It is a kind of neural network algorithm that uses a technique called \"transformers\" and a bit of information to generate new information. For example, if the bit of information is language in the form of \"say i love you in a poem\", a GPT trained in the English language may produce an actual poem.\n",
